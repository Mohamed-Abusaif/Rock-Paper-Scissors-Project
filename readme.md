In this Project we are going to use the following methods and proprties in JavaScript :
- getElementById()
- querySelectorAll()
- forEach()
- addEventListener()
- innerHTML
- e.target.id
- Math.floor()
- Math.random()

I have followed the same Methedology/Process I use in every project
you can read about it on my hashnode blog here : 
https://mohamedabusaif.hashnode.dev/how-to-choose-and-build-your-own-portfolio-projects

Also I learned a lot about how to setup project 
environment and also using git to commit changes and control versions of my app during 
the development step then upload my app to 
github after finishing the project.
